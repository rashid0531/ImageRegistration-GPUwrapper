    # Uses a function in cv2 that finds all important features in an
    # image. I have used something called the SIFT algorithm to do this,
    # instead of one known as SURF
    #    The differences are: Surf has been measured to be about three
    #    times fast than sift. Also, the tradeoff performance whise is that
    #    surf is better than sift at handling blurred images (which may be
    #    particularily for zooming drones and wind whipping the crop), and
    #    rotation, while it's not as good at handling viewpoint change and
    #    illumination change, which wouldn't be as important as blurryness
    #    when it comes to drones. Even with all this, we still need SIFT
    #    due to the ability to only keep the best features
    #
    # Another issue, with both sift and surf, is memory. any feature found
    # take a minimum of 256 bytes, and there are a lot of features
    #
    # The last issue is that both SURF and SIFT are patented, which means
    # that we would have to pay to use them if we used them for some
    # specific stuff
    # An alternative is ORB which is created by OpenCV for this reason.
